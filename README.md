### Lab requirements

  1. Install git
     - Windows: Install via http://git-scm.com
     - OS X: Install with package manager or http://git-scm.com
     - Linux: Install via distribution package manager or http://git-scm.com

  2. Install Erlang & Elixir (at least 1.3)
     - See http://elixir-lang.org/install.html

##### Verify your installations

Verify your installation by calling the executables `git`, `erl` and `iex` in
your shell. Your erlang installation needs to be on OTP 18 and Elixir on 1.3.x
or higher. Check the version by running `iex`:

```
~ Î» iex
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.0] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (1.3.2) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```


### Installing a lab
