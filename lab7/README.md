# Lab7

### Lab purpose

In this lab we will learn how to write tests driven by test coverage. We will
be using ExCoveralls to get coverage reporting.

### Lab instructions

Use `$ mix coveralls` to run the test coverage tool or `$ mix coveralls.detail --filter file.ex`
to run it for a specific file.

Write tests in `test/lab7_test.exs` to fully cover the code in `lib/lab7`.
