# Lab5

## Lab purpose

In Lab 5, each user will be in its own process, and we'll send messages with
an actual Elixir intra-process message. We'll finally make use of the `id` fields
we added to each member.

## Lab instructions

As usual, in the directory `lab5`, you'll see a file called `lib/lab5.ex` with
several stubbed out functions. You can run your tests using `mix test`, and
implement the stubbed out functions until all of your tests pass.
