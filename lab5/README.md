# Lab5

### Lab purpose

This lab will apply the concepts you learned in Lab 4 to Lab 3. When you're done,
you'll have a chat room that will use agents to preserve state.


### Lab instructions

The `lab5` directory has a file `lib/lab5.ex` which contains an implementation of chat
room with some stubbed out functions. As usual, use that template to implement features
in your chatroom until all of your tests pass.

##### Advanced user problems (if you have more time)

If there is enough time try to implement the process
as a normal process with spawn/send/receive. What differences do you notice
from the Agent version and when would you use an Agent instead of
GenServer?
