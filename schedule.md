# Schedule

You learn Elixir best the way you learn any language, by coding. Tests make it easy to attack 
one concept at a time and master one concept before moving on to the next. Since each class 
moves at a different rate, we'll get to as many of these as we can before time runs out. 
We have more content than we'll finish today. 

Each of the sections will have the following parts: 
* Live coding and instruction
* Lab introduction
* Lab Coding
* Lab Review



## Section 1
Learn Elixir mix, the primary build tool, and language basics including 
* mix
* modules and functions
* primatives
* tuples
* lists
* matches

## Section 2
Learn to use core language concepts including
* higher order functions
* Enum
* pipes
* for comprehensions

## Section 3
Learn to use structs and maps to solve real world problems. Start a chat room that uses concepts: 
* structs
* maps
* immutability

## Section 4
Elixir is a concurrent language. Use basic concurrency constructs including
* send
* receive
* spawn

## Section 5
Elixir supports some higher level abstractions for concurrency. We'll cover the simplest, including
* Tasks
* Agents

## Section 6
