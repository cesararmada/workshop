# Schedule

You learn Elixir best the way you learn any language, by coding. Tests make it easy to attack 
one concept at a time and master one concept before moving on to the next. Since each class 
moves at a different rate, we'll get to as many of these as we can before time runs out. 
We have more content than we'll finish today. 

Each of the sections will have the following parts: 
* Live coding and instruction
* Lab introduction
* Lab Coding
* Lab Review



## Section 1: Basics with Mix and language abstractions
Learn Elixir mix, the primary build tool, and language basics including 
* mix
* modules and functions
* primatives
* tuples
* lists
* matches

## Section 2: Lists, tuples, and matches
Learn to use core language concepts including
* higher order functions
* Enum
* pipes
* for comprehensions

## Section 3: Maps, structs and immutability
Learn to use structs and maps to solve real world problems. Start a chat room that uses concepts: 
* structs
* maps
* immutability

## Section 4: Concurrency Primatives
Elixir is a concurrent language. Use basic concurrency constructs including
* send
* receive
* spawn

## Section 5: Basic concurrency abstractions
Elixir supports some higher level abstractions for concurrency. We'll cover the simplest, including
* Tasks
* Agents

## Section 6: OTP
Elixir uses OTP, a concurrency abstraction that is in the center of most advanced Elixir programming.
In this section, we'll cover OTP concepts including
* Call and Cast
* Supervisors

## Breaks and Lunch
Depending on class speed
